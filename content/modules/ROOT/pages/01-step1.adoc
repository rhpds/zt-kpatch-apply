== Getting started with Kernel Live Patching

When a Critical severity Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) is
announced, Red Hat produces updated software package that include fixes
for the CVE. However, historically, to apply an updated kernel package,
organizations needed to schedule a system maintenance as the procedure
for applying a new kernel included a system reboot.

Kernel Live Patching is a service intended for use with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux Extended Update Support (EUS) versions. Red Hat
packages Kernel Live Patches (kpatches) for selected CVEs, which
organizations can apply to their running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
systems to update the system without scheduling a system downtime to
apply a kernel update to address the CVE.

To get started, install the `+kpatch+` package:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf -y install kpatch
----

Now that the `+kpatch+` application is installed, you can verify that
the system does not currently have any kpatches loaded into the kernel.

[source,bash,run]
----
kpatch list
----

As expected, no patch modules are loaded or installed on the machine â€¦
yet.
