== Verifying a Kernel Live Patch

To validate that you have properly applied the Kernel Live Patch, run
the same `+kpatch list+` command you ran on the first step. You will
notice that this time the output is no longer blank.

[source,bash,run]
----
kpatch list
----

From the list output, you can see that the kpatch installed in the
previous step has been applied to the system and is enabled. Now, your
system has been updated to resolve the Critical CVEs in the systems
running kernel.

On the next step, you will look deeper into the patch to see what CVEs
were resolved with the applied kpatch and where to find additional
information from Red Hat on these CVEs and mitigations.
