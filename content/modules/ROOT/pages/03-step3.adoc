== Applying a Kernel Live Patch

You could now install the specific kpatch-patch package you discovered
from the previous step. However, if you were wanting to do this action
on a population of systems, which may each be running a different kernel
(because of where they are in your normal population maintenance,
perhaps). Instead, Red Hat recommends using a dnf install or update
command that embeds a uname -r command to dynamically determine the
running kernel version and utilize it when making the decision of which
kpatch to install:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf -y install "kpatch-patch = $(uname -r)"
----

The previous `+dnf+` command, based on the result of the embedded uname
-r command, installed kpatch-patch-5_14_0-427_31_1, which is what you had
determined on the previous step to be the patchset for this system.
